# Heat-Map
It's an interactive heatmap visualization application to dynamically visualize data, developed with the D3.js library. This application creates an appealingly persuasive and very informative heat map, representing data intensity through color gradients.

It provides a title and description to set things in context and accurately maps data points to their coordinates on a grid. It does data binding, scales, axes, and tooltips  in its implementation through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
